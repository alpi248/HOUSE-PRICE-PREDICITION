Includes a mix of numerical and categorical features describing residential properties
About Dataset
Context
The real estate markets, like those in Sydney and Melbourne, present an interesting opportunity for data analysts to analyze and predict where property prices are moving towards. Prediction of property prices is becoming increasingly important and beneficial. Property prices are a good indicator of both the overall market condition and the economic health of a country. Considering the data provided, we are wrangling a large set of property sales records stored in an unknown format and with unknown data quality issues


ðŸŽ¯ Objective: Build and evaluate regression models that can accurately estimate SalePrice based on key property features.

This project focuses on data cleaning, feature engineering, preprocessing, and model training to deliver reliable predictions.
Understanding the DataÂ¶
The first step in the analysis is to get a quick overview of the dataset structure and contents.
